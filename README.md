# TravelTide_customer_segmentation_Analytics
The following Jupyter Notebook presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Fuzzy Segmentation analysis for TravelTide, an imaginary company that specializes in the travel industry. This repository offers a detailed examination of the company's data and employs fuzzy segmentation techniques to gain valuable insights.

## Background
The TravelTide Customer Segmentation Project is part of our ongoing efforts to enhance customer loyalty through data-driven strategies. The project revolves around analyzing customer data to segment them effectively, which, in turn, assists our Marketing Team in designing a personalized rewards program. This README serves as a guide to understanding the key aspects of the project.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to identify distinct customer segments based on their preferences for different perks. These segments will help in the creation of a personalized rewards program. By offering perks tailored to specific customer groups, we aim to increase customer loyalty and engagement. We plan to measure the success of this approach by analyzing how customers respond to the perks once they are offered.

## Approach
### Data Collection and Processing
• We collected raw data from four essential tables using SQL queries, resulting in a diverse set of metrics.
Python was used for further data processing and analysis.
• We created five distinct indexes, each corresponding to one of the proposed perks.
### Segmentation
• We utilized fuzzy segmentation techniques to classify customers into distinct groups based on their preferences for each perk.

## Principal Insights

### 1. Alignment of User Preferences with Proposed Perks
• The segmentation analysis reveals a strong alignment between the proposed perks and specific customer behaviors.
• The "no cancellation fees" segment comprises more than 1,600 customers, indicating a sizable customer base that highly values these perks.

### 2. Variability in Perk Preferences
• The distribution of indexes for "No Cancellation Fees" shows extensive variability, implying a wider spectrum of customer preferences.
• This variability allows us to cater to a broader range of customer interests.

### 3. Convergence of Perk Preferences
• Users may have relatively high scores for multiple perks, indicating they may have interests in more than one perk.
• This provides an opportunity for cross-promotion or the implementation of tiered reward systems.

### 4. Gender Influence Analysis
• There is a notable higher level of engagement from females compared to males across all perks.
• This suggests the importance of prioritizing features and benefits that appeal to a female audience in the rewards program.

## Recommendations
### 1. Start Test Programs for the Main Customer Groups
• Initiate trial programs targeting the "no cancellation fees" segment, as it is the largest customer group.
### 2. Implement A/B Testing
•Due to differences in perk preferences, consider A/B testing to assess the real-world effectiveness of each perk before a larger-scale launch.
